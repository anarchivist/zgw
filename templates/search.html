$def with (query_string, results, total)
<html>
<head><title>Results for query: $query_string</title>

<h1>$total results for query <em>$query_string</em></h1>

$for result in results:
    $#the colon is necessary as we are passing in raw HTML. sanitation
    $#has been done already, so there are (probably) no security issues.
    <p>$:result</p>
